My github plan-
I am going to fork the original controlbook_public [repo](https://github.com/randybeard/controlbook_public) so that I have my own copy and can push to it. To keep my fork up to date I need to follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39819441/keeping-a-fork-up-to-date) tutorial.

My github steps
Pre- fork and add remote/upstream
1. git fetch upstream (fetches what is upstream)
2. git merge upstream/master (merges upstream into my master branch)
3. Both of the above steps can be done with one step-
   1. git pull upstream/master
