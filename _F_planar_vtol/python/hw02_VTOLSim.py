HW Description: In the _F_VTOL directory, create the simulation launch file 
hw02_VTOLSim.py, and use it to animate the planar VTOL system where the the 
position z follows a sin wave with amplitude of 4 (m), frequency of 0.1 Hz, 
and y_offset of 5 (m), altitude h follows a square wave with amplitude 
of 2 (m), frequency of 0.1 Hz, and
